<br>
<br>
Install the theme provided in the "releses" section to change the windows look&feel to a dark template.<br>
(Simply doublecklick it)<br>
Activate Darkmode in Windows<br>
<br>
To disable the shell and return to the Windows one, go to the Taskmanager (ctrl+alt+del -> Task-Manager) and remove NeutronShell from the autostart list.<br>
<br>
Caveats:<br>
-Some UWP apps don't show up in the taskbar<br>
-Antivirus programs will most likely show false positives.<br>
-Has got to be started as Administrator for TrayIcons to work.<br>
 This would break OS security! I'm still working at fixing this.<br>
<br><br>
Changelog:<br>
-Fixed Windows Explorer icon<br>
-Automatic language detection (en/ger)<br>
-Reduced processor time<br>
-Fixed context menu flickering when hovering above several taskbar items
