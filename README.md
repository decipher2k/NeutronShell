<br>
<br>
Install the theme provided in the "releses" section to change the windows look&feel to a dark template.<br>
(Simply doublecklick it)<br>
<br>
To disable the shell and return to the Windows one, go to the Taskmanager (ctrl+alt+del -> Task-Manager) and remove NeutronShell from the autostart list.<br>
<br>
Caveats:<br>
-Some UWP apps don't show up in the taskbar<br>
-Antivirus programs will most likely show false positives. That's because the shell is doing system stuff, and I can't afford a software certificate ^^
